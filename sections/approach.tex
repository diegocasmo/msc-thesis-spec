\section{Approach}

This section outlines tools and methods which will be used to solve each of the tasks described in \ref{description}.

\subsection{Methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Literature study
    \item The persistence layer will consist of a RESTful API which will communicate using the JSON notation
    \item A cloud environment might be employed for deployment
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tools}
 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \Python programming language (\url{https://www.python.org/}) will be used to implement the persistence layer
    \item the Conda package management system (\url{https://conda.io/docs/}) might be used to manage \Python dependencies
    \item The \Python library \scikit (\url{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/}) will be used to develop the AI-Crawler
    \item The \Python library \ImageDict (\url{https://github.com/kobejohn/imagedict}) might be used for smart caching of images
    \item The thesis report will be written in \LaTeX ~via Overleaf (\url{https://www.overleaf.com})
    \item Git as the version-control system
\end{itemize}
